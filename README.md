# YouTube Clone

## Project Overview
The YouTube Clone is a simplistic web application that mimics the layout and functionality of the popular video streaming platform, YouTube. With a responsive design, it allows users to search for videos, navigate through various sections, and explore video content in a visually appealing manner.

## Installation
To get started with the YouTube Clone, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/youtube-clone.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd youtube-clone
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser (no server is required for this project).

## Usage
Once you have the project open in your browser, you can:

- Use the search bar at the top to type in queries (note that in this demo, it simulates a search without returning actual results).
- Navigate through different sections such as Home, Shorts, Subscriptions, Your Channel, and History using the sidebar.
- Click on video cards to simulate playing a video (an alert will open showing the video title).

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can input search terms to interact with a simulated search mechanism.
- **Dynamic Navigation**: Clicking on navigation links updates the content area with relevant information.
- **Video Cards**: Display sample video content with titles and metadata.
- **Hamburger Menu**: A mobile-friendly sidebar that toggles visibility on smaller screens.

## Dependencies
No additional dependencies are required; the application functions solely with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Project Structure
The project is structured in the following way:

```
/youtube-clone
│
├── index.html        # Main HTML document
├── style.css         # Styles for the application
└── script.js         # JavaScript functionality
```

### Files Overview
